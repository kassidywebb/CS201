# CS 201 Open Source Course Guide

## Before We Begin

The main site template & inital book problems were forked from **[CLRS](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/)**. I wanted to create a full course guide that everyone in CS 201 could learn and/or commit to, therefore I've added additions to represent the CS 201 course material.


## Helping the Class

Additional solutions/thoughts are encouraged. If you have any, please create a pull request through the **[CS 201 GitHub repo](https://kassidywebb.github.io/cs201/)**.
